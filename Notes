@escaping ----> means that the closure executes after the method return.

Escaping Closures:
When you declare a function that takes a closure as one of its parameters,
you can write @escaping before the parameter's type to indicate that the closure is allowed to escape.
One way that a closure can escape is by being stored in a variable that is defined outside the function.

To work without any storyboards : 
1) move the main.storyboard to trash.
2) in General -> Deployment Info -> Main Interface
   change the value of Main Interface from Main.storyboard to Launch.storyboard.
3) create the new main xib file you desired.
4) add these line to didFinishLaunchingWithOptions In appDelegate : 
    window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
    let mainVC = LoginViewController(nibName: "LoginViewController", bundle: nil)
    let nav = UINavigationController(rootViewController: mainVC)
    window?.rootViewController = nav
    window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
